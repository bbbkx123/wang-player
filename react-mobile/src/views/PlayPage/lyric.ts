[00:00.00]
[00:01.68]All it takes is one glance and i'm taken back
[00:09.11]I am under a spore every time that you're near me
[00:16.62]I try not to give in and let myself fall again
[00:23.77]But I'm under a trance and i can't deny this feeling
[00:30.64]
[00:30.93]Watching all the people all around me finding truth
[00:38.19]I can't tell but wonder do you wonder too
[00:45.52]Were we meant for each other but it just fall apart
[00:52.94]Can we last forever If we start over
[01:00.17]
[01:13.21]Over
[01:28.01]Over
[01:29.94]
[01:32.14]You kept the sun shining and turn my world into spring
[01:39.52]I never thought that life could ever change this one reason
[01:46.92]If I could just go back and hold your hand falling fast
[01:54.25]And never let it go cause I won't deny this feeling
[02:00.82]
[02:01.22]Watching all the people all around me finding truth
[02:08.58]I can't tell but wonder do you wonder too
[02:16.02]Were we meant for each other but it just fall apart
[02:23.24]Can we last forever If we start over
[02:30.39]
[02:43.61]Over
[02:58.41]Over

[00:01.68]只要一个回眸我就会放下一切回到你身边
[00:09.11]你靠近我的时候我就如同处于萌发的孢子之下
[00:16.62]我试着不要放弃抵抗自我放逐
[00:23.77]但是你让我着迷沦陷我无法否认
[00:30.93]看着我身边的人都在寻找真实
[00:38.19]虽然我不曾知晓，但我想知道你是不是也在寻找
[00:45.52]原以为我们是命中注定却分道扬镳
[00:52.94]再来一次的话我们就能天长地久吗？
[01:13.21]若能重来
[01:28.01]若能重来
[01:32.14]你是把我的世界点亮成春天的明媚日光
[01:39.52]我从未想过生命只因为你就会如此不同
[01:46.92]希望可以回到过去握住你的手飞速坠入爱河
[01:54.25]然后握住你的手再也不放，我无法否认我现在的留恋
[02:01.22]看着我身边的人都在寻找真实
[02:08.58]虽然我不曾知晓，但我想知道你是不是也在寻找
[02:16.02]原以为我们是命中注定却分道扬镳
[02:23.24]再来一次的话我们就能天长地久吗？
[02:43.61]若能重来
[02:58.41]若能重来
